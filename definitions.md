Loop invariant  
--------------
Initialization: It is true prior to the first iteration of the loop

Maintenance: If it is true before an interation of the loop, it remains true before the next iteration

Termination:  When the loop terminates, the invariant gives us a useful property that helps show that the algorithm is correct

RAM
---
Random-access machine

Input size
----------
Either the number of items or the number of bits, depending on the problem
